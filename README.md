## 🎯 Overview

Managing files is a common task in everyday computing. This **File Management Application** is a Python-based command-line program that helps users perform basic file operations directly from the terminal.

The project is designed to help beginners understand how file handling works in Python using real-world examples and a menu-driven interface.

## 🎓 Key Highlights

- Beginner-friendly Python project  
- Menu-driven command-line interface  
- Real-time file operations  
- Uses Python’s built-in `os` module  
- No external libraries required  

## ✨ Features

### 📂 File Operations

- Create a new file  
- View all files in the current directory  
- Read the contents of a file  
- Edit (append) data to an existing file  
- Delete a file  

### 🧠 Application Logic

- Handles file existence checks  
- Displays user-friendly messages  
- Prevents errors using exception handling  
- Simple and easy-to-use interface  

## 🎬 Demo

### Application Menu

FILE MANAGEMENT APP  
1. Create file  
2. View all files  
3. Delete file  
4. Read file  
5. Edit file  
6. Exit  

## 🆕 Create File

Allows the user to create a new file by providing a filename.  
If the file already exists, the application informs the user.

## 👀 View All Files

Displays all files present in the current working directory.  
If no files are found, an appropriate message is shown.

## 📖 Read File

Reads and displays the content of a specified file.  
If the file does not exist, the application handles the error gracefully.

## ✏️ Edit File

Allows the user to append new content to an existing file.  
The added content is saved without deleting previous data.

## ❌ Delete File

Deletes a specified file permanently from the directory.  
If the file does not exist, an error message is displayed.

## 📖 Usage

Run the application from the terminal and select options from the menu to perform different file operations.  
The program continues running until the user selects the Exit option.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub  
2. Navigate to the project folder  
3. Run the Python file using Python 3  

## 📁 Project Structure

The project consists of:
- A main Python file containing all file management logic  
- A README file for documentation  

## 🔍 How It Works

- Uses Python file handling methods  
- Uses the `os` module to manage files  
- User input determines the operation to perform  
- Exception handling prevents program crashes  
- Menu repeats until the user exits  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Command Line Interface (CLI)  

### Python Concepts Used

- File handling  
- Exception handling  
- Loops  
- Conditional statements  
- User input handling  
- OS module
